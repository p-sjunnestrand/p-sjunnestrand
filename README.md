## General overview

The Petter Sjunnestrand is the latest installment of the Ashatt Assabi Industries' Autonomous Pseudo-Voltonic Lewitt-Hoffenfeld Manifold. It comes with considerable improvements of numerous parameters and is expected to vastly ourperform its predecessors.
When designing the newest version of the automaton, the engineers at Ashatt Assabi Industries Inc. focused on the most salient aspects
of the machine's functionality, i.e. its performance in humanoid interaction and its adaptability to its programmed tasks.
In order to achieve this, the engineers at Ashatt Assabi Industries Inc. had to improve a range of hardware modules while still keeping with the limitations of dimensions of the main frame. Through hard work and ingenious solutions, our engineers were able to produce the most advanced automaton as of yet. A, by no means complete, list of changes follows:

- Improved alpha flux in the berrinium stabilizers.
- Reduced severity of Dreksen outbursts through serialization of the gaustic valves.
- Inner chambers of wave redistributors fitted with Brenzwell alloy to reduce monotone drag.
- Multivectored flux inhibitors scaled down and fitted with rhodium arrestors to increase reliance of polyphasic oscilation. This was reported as a major source of frustration in older versions. The new TRI-VX arrestors will greatly enhance field splicing. No more rouge Reimann peta spikes!
- Added snooze button.
- New 3000 core sinusodial overdrive will greatly improve neutroplasmic recirculation. R-undulation values of at least 40,000 KfL/w to be expected.
- J-/J+ decoherence increased by a factor of seven(!).
